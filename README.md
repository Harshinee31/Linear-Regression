# House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** models to predict house prices based on various features. It uses the House Price dataset and focuses on understanding model performance and interpretation.

##Tools & Libraries

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib

## Features

### Simple Linear Regression
- Predict house price based on a single feature: `area`

### Multiple Linear Regression
- Predict house price using multiple features: `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories`

### Model Evaluation
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- RÂ² Score

### Visualization
- Scatter plot with regression line for simple linear regression

###  Interpretability
- Coefficients and intercept of the multiple linear regression model

## Dataset Columns

- `price` (Target)  
- `area`, `bedrooms`, `bathrooms`, `stories` (Features used in regression)  
- Additional features like `mainroad`, `basement`, `airconditioning`, etc., available for future use
